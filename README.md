# Tile5 V2

Over a year has passed since I wrote Tile5, and since that time other great mapping libraries (primarily [LeafletJS](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/)) have been released and achieve all of the things that I wanted to achieve with Tile5 and more.  

__So it's time to do something a little different with Tile5.__

The V2 branch of Tile5 is a complete rewrite of the library with the focus on the following things:

- Focus on rendering through canvas and WebGL
- Support for panning interfaces beyond just maps.
