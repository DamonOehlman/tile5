It's time for another crack at a pure
[canvas 2d context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) mapping library.

Let's see what magic we can pull off this time....


## Baseline Browser Compatibility

This time around we will be investigating using the following browser
features, which in turn will determine baseline browser support:

- [Canvas - Basic Support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)
- [Canvas - Text API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas-text)
- [Typed Arrays](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays)

Desirable (for possible experimental features):

- [Canvas - Blend Modes](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas-blending)
