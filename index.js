  It's time for another crack at a pure
  [canvas 2d context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) mapping library.

  Let's see what magic we can pull off this time....

  ## Baseline Browser Compatibility

  This time around we will be investigating using the following browser
  features, which in turn will determine baseline browser support:
  
  - [Canvas - Basic Support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)
  - [Canvas - Text API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas-text)
  - [Typed Arrays](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays)

  Desirable (for possible experimental features):

  - [Canvas - Blend Modes](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas-blending)
