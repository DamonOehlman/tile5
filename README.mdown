# About Tile5

Tile5 is a HTML5 mobile-optimized mapping and tiling library, that has
been built from the ground up to support multiple mapping providers. 

If you are interested in mapping, I would start by having a look at the T5.Map
class and if you are looking for more generic applications of the library then either at the T5.Tiler or T5.View classes.
