TILE5.Graphics.View
===================

The Tile5 View is the fundamental building block for tiling and mapping interface.  Which this class does not implement any of the logic required for tiling, it does handle the redraw logic.  Applications implementing Tile5 maps will not need to be aware of the implementation specifics of the View, but for those interested in building extensions or customizations should definitely take a look.  Additionally, it is worth being familiar with the core methods that are implemented here around the layering as these are used extensively when creating overlays and the like for the map implementations.
