# Tile5

Tile5 is currently structured to provide general layered drawing and tiling support in the core, while mapping and GIS functionality is implemented in the Tile5 Geo extension.  In time, it is expected that additionally extensions will be created (such as a 2d tiling game extension).

## The Building Blocks

At the core of Tile5 we have the central building blocks of a T5.View and a T5.ViewLayer and these two classes handle most of the generic work for displaying a layered visual interface.  These are discussed in more detail 
in Tile5 Views.

As Tile5 is primarily built to support the creation of tiling interfaces, the T5.Tiler class and T5.TileGrid also play a critical role.  While it is possible to use Tile5 to build non-tiling interfaces and abstract directly from a T5.View there are other HTML5 canvas related libraries that also provide this functionality and in some cases these may be better suited to your needs.  The section on Tile5 Tiling provides more information on tiling.
