<p><em>extends:</em> <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a></p>

<p>The DrawLayer is a generic layer that handles drawing, hit testing and syncing a list
of drawables.  A <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_drawlayer.js.html#T5.DrawLayer">T5.DrawLayer</a> itself is never meant to be implemented as it has no
internal <code><a href="src_js_graphics_drawables_core.js.html#T5.Drawable">T5.Drawable</a></code> storage, but rather relies on descendants to implement storage and
provide the drawables by the <code>loadDrawables</code> method.</p>

<h2><a href="src_js_geo_types_pos.js.html#Methods">Methods</a></h2>

<h3>find(selector: String)</h3>

<p>The find method will eventually support retrieving all the shapes from the shape
layer that match the selector expression.  For now though, it just returns all shapes</p>

<h3>hitGuess(hitX, hitY, state, view)</h3>

<p>Return true if any of the markers are hit, additionally, store the hit elements
so we don't have to do the work again when drawing</p>

<h3>add(poly)</h3>

<p>Used to add a <a href="src_js_graphics_drawables_poly.js.html#T5.Poly">T5.Poly</a> to the layer</p>
