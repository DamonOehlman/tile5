<p>DRAWABLE</p>

<h2>Constructor</h2>

<p><code>new <a href="src_core_functions.js.html#T5">T5</a>.Drawable(view, layer, params);</code></p>

<h2>## Settings</h2>

<h3>animate(fn, argsStart, argsEnd, opts)</h3>

<h3>drag(dragData, dragX, dragY, drop)</h3>

<h3>draw(renderer, drawData)</h3>

<p>The draw method is provided for custom drawables. Internal drawables will delegate
their drawing to the function that is returned from the various prep* methods of the
renderer, however, when building some applications this really isn't suitable and
more is required.  Thus if required a custom draw method can be implemented to implement
the required functionality.</p>

<h3>getProps(renderer)</h3>

<p>Get the drawable item properties that will be passed to the renderer during
the prepare and draw phase</p>

<h3>resync(view)</h3>

<h3>rotate(value)</h3>

<h3>scale(value)</h3>

<h3>translate(x, y)</h3>

<h3>updateBounds(bounds: XYRect, updateXY: boolean)</h3>
