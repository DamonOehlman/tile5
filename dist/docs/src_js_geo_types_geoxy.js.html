<h1><a name="T5.GeoXY">T5.GeoXY</a></h1>

<p>The GeoXY class is used to convert a position (<a href="src_js_geo_types_position.js.html#T5.Geo.Position">T5.Geo.Position</a>) into a
composite xy that can be used to draw on the various <a href="src_js_graphics_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a> implementations.
This class provides the necessary mechanism that allows the view layers to 
assume operation using a simple vector (containing an x and y) with no need
geospatial awareness built in. <br />
Layers are aware that particular events may require vector resynchronization 
which is facilitated by the <code>syncXY</code> method of the <a href="src_js_geo_ui_map.js.html#T5.Map">T5.Map</a>. </p>
