<h1><a name="T5.XY">T5.XY</a> (Internal Class)</h1>

<p>The internal XY class is currently created by making a call to <code><a href="src_js_core_xyfns.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a>.init</code> rather than <code>new <a href="src_js_core_xyfns.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a></code>.
This will seem strange, and it is strange, and is a result of migrating from a closure based pattern
to a prototypal pattern in areas of the <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> library.</p>

<h2><a href="src_js_geo_types_pos.js.html#Methods">Methods</a></h2>

<h3>add(xy*)</h3>

<p>Return a <strong>new</strong> xy composite that is adds the current value of this xy value with the other xy 
values that have been passed to the function.  The actual value of this XY value remain unchanged.</p>

<h3>equals(xy)</h3>

<p>Return true if the two points are equal, false otherwise.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> This function
does not automatically floor the values so if the point values are floating point
then floating point precision errors will likely occur.</p>
