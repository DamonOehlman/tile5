<h1><a name="T5.View">T5.View</a></h1>

<p>The View is the fundamental building block for tiling and 
mapping interface.  Which this class does not implement any of 
the logic required for tiling, it does handle the redraw logic. <br />
Applications implementing <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> maps will not need to be aware of 
the implementation specifics of the View, but for those interested 
in building extensions or customizations should definitely take a look. <br />
Additionally, it is worth being familiar with the core methods that 
are implemented here around the layering as these are used extensively 
when creating overlays and the like for the map implementations.</p>

<h2>Constructor</h2>

<pre>
var view = new <a href="src_js_graphics_view.js.html#T5.View">T5.View</a>(params);
</pre>

<h4>Initialization Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>container</code> (required)</li>
<li><code>autoSize</code></li>
<li><code>id</code></li>
<li><code>captureHover</code> - whether or not hover events should be intercepted by the View. <br />
If you are building an application for mobile devices then you may want to set this to 
false, but it's overheads are minimals given no events will be generated.</li>
<li><code>inertia</code></li>
<li><code>pannable</code></li>
<li><code>scalable</code></li>
<li><code>panAnimationEasing</code></li>
<li><code>panAnimationDuration</code></li>
<li><code>fps</code> - (int, default = 25) - the frame rate of the view, by default this is set to 
25 frames per second but can be increased or decreased to compensate for device 
performance.  In reality though on slower devices, the framerate will scale back 
automatically, but it can be prudent to set a lower framerate to leave some cpu for 
other processes :)</li>
<li><code>turbo</code> - (bool, default = false) - whether or not all possible performance optimizations
should be implemented.  In this mode certain features such as transparent images in <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_imagelayer.js.html#T5.ImageLayer">T5.ImageLayer</a>
will not have these effects applied.  Additionally, clipping is disabled and clearing the background
rectangle never happens.  This is serious stuff folks.</li>
<li><code>zoomEasing</code> - (easing, default = <code>quad.out</code>) - The easing effect that should be used when 
the user double taps the display to zoom in on the view.</li>
<li><code>zoomDuration</code> - (int, default = 300) - If the <code>zoomEasing</code> parameter is specified then 
this is the duration for the tween.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Events</h2>

<h3>tapHit</h3>

<p>This event is fired when the view has been tapped (or the left
mouse button has been pressed)</p>

<pre>
view.bind('tapHit', function(evt, elements, absXY, relXY, offsetXY) {
});
</pre>

<ul>
<li>elements ([]) - an array of elements that were "hit"</li>
<li>absXY (<a href="src_js_core_vector.js.html#T5.Vector">T5.Vector</a>) - the absolute position of the tap</li>
<li>relXY (<a href="src_js_core_vector.js.html#T5.Vector">T5.Vector</a>) - the position of the tap relative to the top left position of the view.</li>
<li>gridXY (<a href="src_js_core_vector.js.html#T5.Vector">T5.Vector</a>) - the xy coordinates of the tap relative to the scrolling grid offset.</li>
</ul>

<h3>hoverHit</h3>

<p>As per the tapHit event, but triggered through a mouse-over event.</p>

<h3>refresh</h3>

<p>This event is fired once the view has gone into an idle state or every second
(configurable).</p>

<pre>
view.bind('refresh', function(evt) {
});
</pre>

<h3>drawComplete</h3>

<p>Triggered when drawing the view has been completed (who would have thought).</p>

<pre>
view.bind('drawComplete', function(evt, viewRect, tickCount) {
});
</pre>

<ul>
<li>offset (<a href="src_js_core_vector.js.html#T5.Vector">T5.Vector</a>) - the view offset that was used for the draw operation</li>
<li>tickCount - the tick count at the start of the draw operation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>zoomLevelChange</h3>

<p>Triggered when the zoom level of the view has changed.  Given that <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> was primarily
built to serve as a mapping platform zoom levels are critical to the design so a view
has this functionality.</p>

<pre>
view.bind('zoomLevelChange', function(evt, zoomLevel) {
});
</pre>

<ul>
<li>zoomLevel (int) - the new zoom level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>detach</h3>

<p>If you plan on reusing a single canvas element to display different views then you 
will definitely want to call the detach method between usages.</p>

<h3>eachLayer(callback)</h3>

<p>Iterate through each of the ViewLayers and pass each to the callback function 
supplied.</p>

<h3>getLayer(id: String): <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a></h3>

<p>Get the ViewLayer with the specified id, return null if not found</p>

<h3>getOffset(): <a href="src_js_core_xy.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a></h3>

<p>Return a <a href="src_js_core_xy.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a> containing the current view offset</p>

<h3>getRenderer(): <a href="src_js_graphics_renderers_base.js.html#T5.Renderer">T5.Renderer</a></h3>

<h3>getScaleFactor(): float</h3>

<p>Return the current scaling factor</p>

<h3>getZoomLevel(): int</h3>

<p>Return the current zoom level of the view, for views that do not support
zooming, this will always return a value of 1</p>

<h3>setMaxOffset(maxX: int, maxY: int, wrapX: bool, wrapY: bool)</h3>

<p>Set the bounds of the display to the specified area, if wrapX or wrapY parameters
are set, then the bounds will be wrapped automatically.</p>

<h3>getViewport(): <a href="src_js_core_xyrect.js.html#T5.XYRect">T5.XYRect</a></h3>

<p>Return a <a href="src_js_core_xyrect.js.html#T5.XYRect">T5.XYRect</a> for the last drawn view rect</p>

<h3>pan(x: int, y: int, tweenFn: EasingFn, tweenDuration: int, callback: fn)</h3>

<p>Used to pan the view by the specified x and y.  This is simply a wrapper to the 
updateOffset function that adds the specified x and y to the current view offset.
Tweening effects can be applied by specifying values for the optional <code>tweenFn</code> and
<code>tweenDuration</code> arguments, and if a notification is required once the pan has completed
then a callback can be supplied as the final argument.</p>

<h3>setLayer(id: String, value: <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a>)</h3>

<p>Either add or update the specified view layer</p>

<h3>refresh()</h3>

<p>Manually trigger a refresh on the view.  Child view layers will likely be listening for <code>refresh</code>
events and will do some of their recalculations when this is called.</p>

<h3>removeLayer(id: String)</h3>

<p>Remove the <a href="src_js_graphics_layers_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a> specified by the id</p>

<h3>scale(targetScaling: float, targetXY: <a href="src_js_core_xy.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a>, tweenFn: EasingFn, callback: fn)</h3>

<p>Scale the view to the specified <code>targetScaling</code> (1 = normal, 2 = double-size and 0.5 = half-size).</p>

<h3>setZoomLevel(value: int, zoomXY: <a href="src_js_core_xy.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a>): boolean</h3>

<p>This function is used to update the zoom level of the view.  The zoom level 
is checked to ensure that it falls within the <code>minZoom</code> and <code>maxZoom</code> values.  Then
if the requested zoom level is different from the current the zoom level is updated
and a <code>zoomLevelChange</code> event is triggered</p>

<h3>syncXY(points, reverse)</h3>

<p>This function is used to keep a <a href="src_js_core_xy.js.html#T5.XY">T5.XY</a> derivative x and y position in sync
with it's real world location (if it has one).  <a href="src_js_geo_types_geoxy.js.html#T5.GeoXY">T5.GeoXY</a> are a good example 
of this.</p>

<p>If the <code>reverse</code> argument is specified and true, then the virtual world 
coordinate will be updated to match the current x and y offsets.</p>

<h3>triggerAll(eventName: string, args*)</h3>

<p>Trigger an event on the view and all layers currently contained in the view</p>

<h3>updateOffset(x: int, y: int, tweenFn: EasingFn, tweenDuration: int, callback: fn)</h3>

<p>This function allows you to specified the absolute x and y offset that should 
become the top-left corner of the view.  As per the <code>pan</code> function documentation, tween and
callback arguments can be supplied to animate the transition.</p>
