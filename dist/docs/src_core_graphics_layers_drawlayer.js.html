<h1><a name="LAYER: Draw">LAYER: Draw</a></h1>

<h3>clear()</h3>

<h3>create(type, settings, prepend)</h3>

<h3>draw(renderer, viewport, view, tickCount, hitData)</h3>

<h3>find(selector: String)</h3>

<p>The find method will eventually support retrieving all the shapes from the shape
layer that match the selector expression.  For now though, it just returns all shapes</p>

<h3>hitGuess(hitX, hitY, view)</h3>

<p>Return true if any of the markers are hit, additionally, store the hit elements
so we don't have to do the work again when drawing</p>
