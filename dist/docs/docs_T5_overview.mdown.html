<h1><a name="Tile5">Tile5</a></h1>

<p><a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> is currently structured to provide general layered drawing and tiling support in the core, while mapping and GIS functionality is implemented in the <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> Geo extension.  In time, it is expected that additionally extensions will be created (such as a 2d tiling game extension).</p>

<h2>The Building Blocks</h2>

<p>At the core of <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> we have the central building blocks of a <a href="src_js_graphics_view.js.html#T5.View">T5.View</a> and a <a href="src_js_graphics_viewlayer.js.html#T5.ViewLayer">T5.ViewLayer</a> and these two classes handle most of the generic work for displaying a layered visual interface.  These are discussed in more detail 
in <a href="docs_T5_views.mdown.html#Tile5 Views">Tile5 Views</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> is primarily built to support the creation of tiling interfaces, the <a href="src_js_core.js.html#T5">T5</a>.Tiler class and <a href="src_js_core.js.html#T5">T5</a>.TileGrid also play a critical role.  While it is possible to use <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> to build non-tiling interfaces and abstract directly from a <a href="src_js_graphics_view.js.html#T5.View">T5.View</a> there are other HTML5 canvas related libraries that also provide this functionality and in some cases these may be better suited to your needs.  The section on <a href="docs_T5_tiling.mdown.html#Tile5 Tiling">Tile5 Tiling</a> provides more information on tiling.</p>
