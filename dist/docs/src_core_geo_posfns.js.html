<h3>generalize(sourceData, requiredPositions, minDist)</h3>

<p>To be completed</p>

<h3>parseArray(sourceData)</h3>

<p>Just like parse, but with lots of em'</p>

<h3>vectorize(positions, options)</h3>

<p>The vectorize function is used to take an array of positions specified in the 
<code>positions</code> argument and convert these into xy values. By default
the vectorize function will process these asyncronously and will return a 
COG Worker that will be taking care of chunking up and processing the request
in an efficient way.  It is, however, possible to specify that the conversion should
happen synchronously and in this case the array of vectors is returned rather
than a worker instance.</p>
