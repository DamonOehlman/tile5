<h1><a name="Tile5">Tile5</a></h1>

<p><a href="README.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> is a HTML5 mobile-optimized mapping and tiling library, that has
been built from the ground up to support multiple mapping providers. </p>

<p>If you are interested in mapping, I would start by having a look at the <a href="src_js_geo_map.js.html#T5.Map">T5.Map</a>
class and if you are looking for more generic applications of the library then either at the <a href="src_js_core.js.html#T5">T5</a>.Tiler or <a href="src_js_graphics_view.js.html#T5.View">T5.View</a> classes.</p>

<p>For more information see the tile5 website: <a class="external" href="http://www.tile5.org/">www.tile5.org</a></p>
