<h1><a name="T5.XY">T5.XY</a></h1>

<p>This module contains simple functions for creating and manipulating an object literal that 
contains an <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value.  Previously this functionaliy lived in the <a href="src_js_functions.js.html#T5">T5</a>.V module but has
been moved to communicate it's more generic implementation.  The <a href="src_js_functions.js.html#T5">T5</a>.V module still exists, however,
and also exposes the functions of this module for the sake of backward compatibility.</p>

<h3>add(xy*)</h3>

<p>Return a new xy composite that is the value of all the xy values added together.</p>

<h3>absSize(vector)</h3>

<h3>copy(src)</h3>

<p>Return a new xy composite that is a copy of the one passed to the function</p>

<h3>diff(pt1, pt2)</h3>

<p>Return a point that is difference between the x and y values of <code>xy1</code> and <code>xy2</code>.</p>

<h3>distance(xy*)</h3>

<p>Return the total euclidean distance between all the xy values passed to the 
function.</p>

<h3>edges(points, count)</h3>

<h3>equals(pt1, pt2)</h3>

<p>Return true if the two points are equal, false otherwise.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> This function
does not automatically floor the values so if the point values are floating point
then floating point precision errors will likely occur.</p>

<h3>extendBy(xy, theta, delta)</h3>

<h3>floor(pt*)</h3>

<p>This function is used to take all the points in the array and convert them to
integer values</p>

<h3>getRect(xy*)</h3>

<p>Get a XYRect composite that is large enough to contain the xy values passed
to the function.</p>

<h3>init(x, y)</h3>

<p>Initialize a new point that can be used in <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a>.  A point is simply an 
object literal with the attributes <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.  If initial values are passed
through when creating the point these will be used, otherwise 0 values will 
be used.</p>

<h3>invert(xy)</h3>

<p>Return a new composite xy value that is the inverted value of the one passed
to the function.</p>

<h3>max(xy1, xy2)</h3>

<h3>min(xy1, xy2)</h3>

<h3>offset(xy, offsetX, offsetY)</h3>

<p>Return a new composite xy which is offset by the specified amount.</p>

<h3>scale(xy, scaleFactor)</h3>

<p>Returns a new composite xy that has been scaled by the specified scale factor</p>

<h3>simplify(xy*, generalization)</h3>

<p>This function is used to simplify a xy array by removing what would be considered
'redundant' xy positions by elimitating at a similar position.  </p>

<h3>theta (xy1, xy2, distance)</h3>

<h3>toString(xy)</h3>

<p>Return the string representation of the xy</p>
