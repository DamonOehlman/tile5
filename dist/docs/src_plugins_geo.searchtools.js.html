<p><strong>PLUGIN</strong>: <code>plugins/geo.searchtools.js</code>
The <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> search tools plugin is an extraction of some of the core search
functionality that was originally implemented in the core <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> library. Basically
the goal is to create a suite of tools that assist with the rationalization of 
multiple search results across a number of disparate stores and help aggregate 
those into a single meaningful set of results.
Depending on the capabilities of the current browser the search tools module is 
capable of taking forward geocoding requests, reverse geocoding requests, direction
requests and 'Current Location' requests and attempting to provide results based
on the geo engines that are currently available in the <a href="docs_T5_overview.mdown.html#Tile5">Tile5</a> application.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<h2>Module Methods</h2>

<h3>search(args, callback)</h3>

<p>The search method represents the guts of the SearchTools module. The args parameter accepts 
either a simple string or an object literal which is then passed onto suitable search agents.</p>
